# Purpose
* The annotation.json file in the COCO dataset contains information about the keypoints for human pose estimation, including the x, y coordinates of the keypoints, the body part that corresponds to the keypoint (e.g. left knee, right elbow), and the visibility of the keypoint (e.g. occluded or visible). It also includes information about the object instances in the images, including the object class, bounding box, and segmentation mask.

# Structure and key points
The annotation.json file in the COCO dataset for human pose estimation has a specific structure that includes the following fields:

1. "images" : This field contains information about the images in the dataset, including the file name, height, and width of the image.
2. "annotations" : This field contains the annotations for the images, including the keypoints and object instances. For each annotation, it includes the following fields:
    1. "image_id" : The ID of the image that the annotation corresponds to.
    2. "category_id" : The ID of the object category that the annotation corresponds to.
    3. "keypoints" : An array of x, y coordinates for the keypoints, along with a visibility flag (0 for invisible, 1 for visible, 2 for labeled but not visible).
        * Since there are 17 keypoints and each having three parameters (x, y, visibility), there shold be 51 points in the same order.
    4. "bbox" : The bounding box coordinates for the object instance.
        * Note that for bounding box the array respresents [x-corrdinate of the top left corner, y-corrdinate of the same, width of the bounding box, height of the bounding box]
    5. "segmentation" : The segmentation mask for the object instance.
    6. "categories" : This field contains information about the object categories in the dataset, including the name and ID of the category.
3. "licenses" : This field contains information about the license for the dataset.
